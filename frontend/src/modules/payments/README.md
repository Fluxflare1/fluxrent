Here’s a README.md for the Payments Module, aligned with the same structure and tone we used for Rent and Bills.


---

Payments Module

The Payments Module manages tenant payments across invoices (rent, utilities, or other bills), supports integration with wallets, and provides reporting for property managers and admins.

This module is tightly integrated with the Bills module (for invoices) and the Wallet module (for automatic debits, credits, and tracking).


---

Features

Tenant Payments

Pay invoices (Rent, Utility, Other).

Multiple payment methods: wallet, card, or bank transfer (depending on integration).

Manager/Admin Reports

Global report of all payments.

Ability to filter reports by tenant, status, method, or invoice.

Downloadable/printable payment reports.


Tenant Statements

Integration

Linked to Bills for invoices and items.

Backend

Models

PaymentRecord
Stores each payment attempt or confirmation with fields like:

invoice (FK → Invoice)

tenant (FK → User)

method (wallet/card/bank)

amount, status, created_at, updated_at


WalletTransaction (via Wallet module)
Ensures balance adjustments are logged when a tenant pays using their wallet.

POST /pay/ – Tenant pays an invoice.

GET /records/ – List tenant’s own payment history.

Integration Points

Bills → Payments

Each invoice can have one or more payments linked.

Payments update invoice is_paid status.


Wallet → Payments

Payments using wallet debit the tenant’s wallet.

Each wallet debit/credit generates a WalletTransaction.




---

Usage Flow

1. Tenant logs in and goes to Payments page.


2. Tenant selects an invoice and pays (via wallet, card, or bank).


3. Payment record is created and invoice status updated.


4. Wallet is updated if wallet method is used.


5. Tenant can view their history on the same screen.


6. Managers/Admins view reports and pull tenant statements from Reports screen.




---

Roles

Tenant

Can pay invoices.

Can view only their own payment history.


Manager/Admin

Can view reports for all tenants.

Can pull individual tenant statements.




---

Next Steps

Add export to CSV/PDF for reports.

Add filter UI (date range, method, status) for managers.

Integrate real payment gateways (Flutterwave, Paystack, etc.) for card/bank payments.



---

✅ With this, the Payments Module is complete and aligned with Bills, Wallet, and the system SRS.

Would you like me to now proceed with writing the README.md for the Reports/Analytics module (since we already started manager reports here), or should we move straight into implementing Service Charges / Utilities billing next?
