## 3. ✅ Next Steps  

Since we’re aligned on **full-scale production-ready code (no scaffold/draft)**:  
👉 I’ll now **start implementing the backend models directly from `/docs/DATA_MODELS.md`** under `backend/` with migrations, managers, and serializers included.  

Do you want me to begin with **`users` app models (User + KYC + Role assignment + UID system)** as Phase 1?
